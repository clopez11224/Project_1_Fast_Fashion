        <a href=""><p>Fast fashion contributes to environmental pollution. One way in particular is land pollution because of two main factors, adding clothing to landfills and adding incarcerated clothes to landfills. Since fast fashion produces lower quality clothes these garments get worn out much more easily than typical garments of higher quality which most people usually throw out rather than donate anyway adding on to the landfill problem. </p></a>

        <a href=""><p>The solution to fast fashion is using biodegradable material for clothing instead. Fast fashion typically uses cheap alternatives to cotton such as viscose. Viscose is made up of wood fibers which is not recyclable and bad for the environment. As an alternative a company called Spinnova has come up with a way to turn wood fibers into recyclable fibers which can help immensely with fast fashions' contribution to land pollution. </p></a>

        <p>As an average person there are still many things you have control over that can make an immense difference against environmental pollution from the fashion industry. Firstly, SPEAK-UP! Don’t be shy about speaking out against pollution caused by the fashion industry, speak your mind and say it with your chest out. Two, DONATE your clothes instead of throwing them out and contributing to landfills. Lastly, educate yourself and read up more on this topic.
