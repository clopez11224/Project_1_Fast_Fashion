        <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/06/10/why-fashion-needs-to-be-more-sustainable/"><p>Producing Polyester releases two to three times more
        carbon emissions than cotton. Fast Fashion is responsible for 10% of
        humanities carbon emissions. These emissions are the result of 
        production, manufacturing and transportation of garments. Synthetic 
        materials are made from fossil fuels and most clothing is made from 
        countries that use coal, a dirty energy source.</p></a>

        <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#effects"><p>At this pace, the fast fashion industry will 
        increase by 50% in 2030. That's only eight years away. These emissions
        contribute to global warming and climate change. This can cause 
        extreme temperatures in certain parts of the world as well as 
        wildfires. Smog is produced from these emissions which decreases 
        visibility, irritate the eyes, throat and lungs. Soot is even worse
        because it penetrates the bloodstream and lungs which could lead to
        death.</p></a>

        <a href=""><p>We can prevent contributing to air pollution by 
        choosing natural fibers. Buy clothes that are made in countries 
        using renewable energy. Buy less clothes that are better quality. 
        Mend and repair clothing. Don't just throw them out. Don't buy the
        newest trend that is released. Buying will just contribute to these 
        emissions.</p></a>
